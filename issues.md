# Issues in the code:

- Multiple calls from umanager.py
- Consider using one big python file. It may be a lot to take in but prevents constant, redundant calls.
- You have a lot of redundant code in your functions.
  - You should consider creating new functions to handle the security protocols and have the function return a boolean value.
- A few spelling errors. Don´t worry I don´t know how to spell either
